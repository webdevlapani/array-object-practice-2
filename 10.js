/**
 * 

Consider the following array:

let nums = [11, 22, 33, 46, 75, 86, 97, 98];

Use filter then map functions to filter even numbers then square them. Assign the result to a variable named squaredEvenNums and display it. The output should be:

squaredEvenNums: [484, 2116, 7396, 9604]

Use the reduce function to calculate the sum of nums array. The output should be:

Sum of array elements: 468
